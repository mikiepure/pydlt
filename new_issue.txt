Hello, but sorry to commit this txt file to your repo.
First, thanks a lot for your awesome work in this repo.
Recently I used this repo for reading and writing *.dlt files in my project.
I found that it can not write the message with utf-8 encoding payload content to dlt files.

For example:

import os
import shutil
from pydlt import DltFileReader, DltFileWriter

def read_and_write_back_dlt_file(dlt_file_path, output_dlt_file):
    msg_list = []
    # Read DLT messages from file
    for msg in DltFileReader(dlt_file_path, encoding="utf-8"):
        msg_list.append(msg)
    sorted_msg_list = sorted(msg_list, key=lambda d: d.std_header.timestamp)
    # Write DLT messages to file
    with DltFileWriter(output_dlt_file) as writer:
        writer.write_messages(sorted_msg_list)



But after I changed the method as following, it worked:


import os
import shutil
from pydlt import DltFileReader, DltFileWriter

def read_and_write_back_dlt_file(dlt_file_path, output_dlt_file):
    msg_list = []
    # Read DLT messages from file
    for msg in DltFileReader(dlt_file_path, encoding="utf-8"):
        msg_list.append(msg)
    sorted_msg_list = sorted(msg_list, key=lambda d: d.std_header.timestamp)
    # Write DLT messages to file
    with DltFileWriter(output_dlt_file) as writer:
        # writer.write_messages(sorted_msg_list)
        for msg in sorted_msg_list:
            msg.payload.arguments[0].is_utf8 = True
            msg.payload.arguments[0]._encoding = "utf-8"
            writer.write_message(msg)


Do you notice that I changed the properties "is_utf8" and "_encoding" before writing messages to the dlt file?
I think there will be better solutions for such circumstance, don't you?

By the way, I can not submit an issue to this repo for some reason I don't know, that's why I submit this txt file.
Sorry again.
